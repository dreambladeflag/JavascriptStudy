#### 最小平移向量

最小平移向量是指：如果要让某个物体不再与另一个物体发生碰撞，所需移动的最小距离。

##### 实现一个简单的最小平移向量对象

```javascript
function MinimumTranslationVector(axis, overlap) {
    this.axis = axis; // axis is a vector
    this.overlap = overlap; // overlap is a scalar (single value)
}
```

##### 向量投影对象新增计算投影重叠部分长度方法

```javascript
class Projection {
    ...
    
    // calculate overlap and return
    overlap (projection) {
        let overlap = 0;
        
        // overlaps
        if (this.overlaps(projection)) {
            let length1 = this.max - this.min;
            let length2 = projection.max - projection.min;
            
            overlap = Math.abs(length1 - length2);
        }
        
        return overlap;
    }
}
```



##### 重新实现一个返回最小平移向量的分离轴检测函数

```javascript
function separationOnAxesWithMinimumTranslationVector(axes, shape1, shape2) {
    let minimumOverlap = Infinity;
    let overlap;
    let axisWithSmallestOverlap;
    
    for(let i = 0, len = axes.length; i < len; i++) {
        let axis = axes[i];
        let projection1 = shape1.project(axis);
        let projection2 = shape2.project(axis);
        
        overlap = projection1.overlap(projection2);
        
        if (overlap === 0) {
            // no collision
            return {
                axis: undefined,
                overlap: 0
            }
        } else {
            if (overlap < minimumOverlap) {
                minimumOverlap = overlap;
                axisWithSmallestOverlap = axis;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // collision
    return {
        axis: axisWithSmallestOverlap,
        overlap: minimumOverlap
    }
}
```
